## IBM and EDM 

**IBM1** - histone demethylase catalyzes removal of H3K9 \
Mutants have multiple dev defects \
IBM1 protects transcripts from non-CG methylation and associated silencing\
IBM1 has a large highly methylated intron\

**Genome browser of putative maize homolog - I don't see the same methylation pattern, but there are some low coverage areas overlapping TEs that could by high in mCHG**

**EDM2** - discovered in forward genetic screen in Arabadopsis.  \
Antisilencing factor with role in preventing CHG methylation in gene bodies \
Recognizes metylated H3k9 and promotes 3' polyA of IBM transcripts \
Other genes with large introns require EDM2 for 3' polyA and proper expression \

## What are the maize and Setaria homologs?

**maize** \
These are cpm values from Peng's B73 23 tissues expression data
I looked up the 3 v4 gene IDs based on v5 IDs
**It looks like expression is pretty solid in leaf tissue**\

**setaria** \
I think these are/may be the Svm homologs \
IBM - Svm5g0030280 (Sevir5g229100) I don't see much in the way of CHG methylated introns  - expressed highly in our leaf dataset in both WT and ∆drm\
EDM - Svm2g0022350* (Sevir2G166700) * I think this might be 0022351 (or 0022370) instead or in addition - this gene does have a highly CHG methylated \
       intron - moderate expression in WT and ∆drm, not a big change between them - also the methylation doesn't change much in the mutant, strangely a \
       patch of CHG methylation shows up in an intron that is unmethylated in wildtype...\
       Also methylated in a10 genome data \
